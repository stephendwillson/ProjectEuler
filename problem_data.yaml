  - number: "6"
    name: "SUM SQUARE DIFFERENCE"
    url: "https://projecteuler.net/problem=6"
    description: |
      The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
      1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

      The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
      (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

      Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
      numbers and the square of the sum is,
      3025 - 385 = 2640

      Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
      natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    url: "https://projecteuler.net/problem=12"
    description: |
      The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
      So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first
      ten terms would be:

      1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

      Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:

          1: 1
          3: 1,3
          6: 1,2,3,6
          10: 1,2,5,10
          15: 1,3,5,15
          21: 1,3,7,21
          28: 1,2,4,7,14,28

      We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over five divisors.

      What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
      divisors?

      The following iterative sequence is defined for the set of positive integers:

      n → n/2 (n is even)
      n → 3n + 1 (n is odd)

      Using the rule above and starting with 13, we generate the following sequence:
      13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1

      It can be seen that this sequence (starting at 13 and finishing at 1) contains
      10 terms. Although it has not been proved yet (Collatz Problem), it is thought
      that all starting numbers finish at 1.

      If d(a) = b and d(b) = a, where a ≠ b, then a and b are an amicable pair and
      each of a and b are called amicable numbers.

      For example, the proper divisors of 220 are 1, 2, 4, 5, 10, 11, 20, 22, 44, 55
      and 110; therefore d(220) = 284. The proper divisors of 284 are 1, 2, 4, 71

      A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is
      exactly equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of
      28 would be 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.

      A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than
      n and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.

      As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest
      number that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24.
      By mathematical analysis, it can be shown that all integers greater than
      28123 can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers. However, this upper
      limit cannot be reduced any further by analysis even though it is known that
      the greatest number that cannot be expressed as the sum of two abundant
      numbers is less than this limit.

      It turns out that the formula will produce 40 primes for the consecutive

      40^2 + 40 + 41 = 40(40 + 1) + 41 is divisible by 41, and certainly when n = 41,
      41^2 + 41 + 41 is clearly divisible by 41.

      The incredible formula n^2 - 79n + 1601 was discovered, which produces
      80 primes for the consecutive values 0 <= n <= 79. The product of the
      coefficients, -79 and 1601, is -126479.

      Surprisingly there are only three numbers that can be written as the sum of
      fourth powers of their digits:

          1634 = 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4
          8208 = 8^4 + 2^4 + 0^4 + 8^4
          9474 = 9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4

      As 1 = 1^4 is not a sum it is not included.

      The sum of these numbers is 1634 + 8208 + 9474 = 19316.

      Find the sum of all the numbers that can be written as the sum of fifth powers
      of their digits.

      In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p).
      There are eight coins in general circulation:

          1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).

      It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

          1x£1 + 1x50p + 2x20p + 1x5p + 1x2p + 3x1p

      How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?

      We shall say that an n-digit number is pandigital if it makes use of all the
      digits 1 to n exactly once; for example, the 5-digit number, 15234,
      is 1 through 5 pandigital.

      The product 7254 is unusual, as the identity, 39 x 186 = 7254,
      containing multiplicand, multiplier, and product is 1 through 9 pandigital.

      Find the sum of all products whose multiplicand/multiplier/product identity
      can be written as a 1 through 9 pandigital.

      HINT: Some products can be obtained in more than one way so be sure to only
      include it once in your sum.

      The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
      in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8,
      which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.

      We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.

      There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction,
      less than one in value,
      and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.

      If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
      find the value of the denominator.

      The number 3797 has an interesting property. Being prime itself, it is
      possible to continuously remove digits from left to right, and remain prime
      at each stage: 3797, 797, 97, and 7. Similarly we can work from right to left:
      3797, 379, 37, and 3.

      Find the sum of the only eleven primes that are both truncatable from left to

      The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by, tn = ½n(n+1); so
      the first ten triangle numbers are:

      1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

      By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding to its
      alphabetical position and adding these values we form a word value.
      For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11 + 25 = 55 = t10. If the word
      value is a triangle number then we shall call the word a triangle word.
